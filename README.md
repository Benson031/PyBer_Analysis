# PyBer_Analysis

Overall:

  This project is to help V.Isualize gernate a summary of DataFrame to analyze the rid-sharing data. Then, i will be using Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city.
  
 Results:
 
  Based on the line chart, it doesn't perform any realtion between the fare and date. The data came out with no pattern to follow along. Sometime three type of the city have the amount of fare raise at the same period, but some of them don't. However, we do learned from the summary DataFrame. Although Urban city generate more rides than other two types of city, it is competetive that the number of drivers are bigger than the total rides. In this case, there are at least 32% of the riders can't recieve at least one customer. As the result drivers seem likely to drive in suburban city because of the higher demand.
  
 Summary:
 
  It will be great to look in each days data to analyze the cercomstances of daily amount of drivers and the demand. The problem of this version of Dataframe is that you don't know when do the driversdecide to work. Some of the drivers only work a couple days in a week because it's a part time job. It may occur that the amount of driver exceed the demand on Tuesday but under the demand on Thursday.![Pyber_fare_summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106589258/179133037-8291f5b4-d2bd-4bb8-8ca6-a92e163ba69f.png)
